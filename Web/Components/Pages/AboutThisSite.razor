                <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
                <p>
                    I built this site to showcase my skills as a .NET web developer. I wanted to create a site that was
                    visually appealing, easy to navigate, and responsive on all devices. I also wanted to create a site
                    that was easy to update and maintain, so I decided to build it using Blazor Server.

                <h2>How I Built This Site</h2>
                <p>
                    I built this site using Blazor Server, a web framework from Microsoft that allows you to build
                    interactive web applications using C# and .NET. It is being hosted on Google Cloud Run in a Docker
                    container. The source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/ksbecker/kevinandnell.com"
                        target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and I used Visual Studio Code for development.
